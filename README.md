# Wetsy
[w]Etsy is an online store where you can buy or sell any product as long as it has to do with the water. This website was built with Ruby on Rails and a lot of love by Kelly, Tammy, and Jennie. We used Agile practices (stand-up meetings, weekly demos, etc.) to create user stories to complete our project. You can see our [completed Trello board here](https://trello.com/b/mxIvtRi2/wetsy-planning).

# Accessing the website
You can view the website live at [Wetsy](https://wetsy.herokuapp.com/)

# Applying New Concepts

We did a few new things in this project:
- model relationships: has_many, through and has_and_belongs_to_many
- building user authentication from scratch
- using the session hash to store cart and logged in user information
- before_action controller filters for determining which users could view which pages
